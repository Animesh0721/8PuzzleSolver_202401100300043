The 8-puzzle problem is a classic sliding tile problem that consists of a 3Ã—3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to move the tiles to reach a goal state by sliding them into the empty space. The problem is solved using A Search Algorithm*, which finds the optimal solution using the Manhattan Distance heuristic.
